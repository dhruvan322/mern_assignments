    <h2>History</h2>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry<a href="#ref5">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags"<a href="#ref6">[6]</a>, first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991<a href="#ref7">[7]</a><a href="#ref8">[8]</a>. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4<a href="#ref9">[9]</a>.</p>

<p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax<a href="#ref10">[10]</a><a href="#ref11">[11]</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already‑implemented features like tables and fill‑out forms<a href="#ref12">[12]</a>.</p>

<p>In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based<a href="#ref13">[13]</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)<a href="#ref14">[14]</a>. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014<a href="#ref15">[15]</a>.</p>

<p>Document markup languages Comparison of browser engines</p>

<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>

<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;<strong style="color:green;">img</strong>&gt; and &lt;<strong style="color:green;">input</strong>&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

<p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[3] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the &lt;canvas&gt; element, together with JavaScript.</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009</p>
<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[5]</p>

<p>The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by CERN SGML, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[9]</p>

<p>HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time‑Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>

<p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type definition to define the syntax.[10][11] The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding in‑line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already‑implemented features like tables and fill‑out forms.[12]</p>

<p>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.[13]</p>

<p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).[14] In 2000, HTML became an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.[15]</p>

<h3>HTML version timeline</h3>
<p><strong>HTML 2</strong><br>
November 24, 1995<br>
HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:<br>
November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)<br>
May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)<br>
August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)<br>
January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</p>

<p><strong>HTML 3</strong><br>
January 14, 1997<br>
HTML 3.2[16] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[17] Initially code-named "Wilbur",[18] HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft’s marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[14] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.</p>

<p><strong>HTML 4</strong><br>
December 18, 1997<br>
HTML 4.0[19] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:<br>
Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden<br>
Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed<br>
Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.<br>
Initially code-named "Cougar",[18] HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.[20]<br>
April 24, 1998<br>
HTML 4.0[21] was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.<br>
December 24, 1999<br>
HTML 4.01[22] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata[23] were published on May 12, 2001.<br>
May 2000<br>
ISO/IEC 15445:2000[24] ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.[25]</p>

<p>After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML‑based language XHTML occupied the W3C’s HTML Working Group.</p>

<h2>Main article: XHTML</h2>
<p>XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML 4.01 using XML 1.0. It is now referred to as the XML syntax for HTML and is no longer being developed as a separate standard.[59][60][61][62][63][64][65]</p>

<h2>Transition of HTML publication to WHATWG</h2>
<p>On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards.[66][67][68][69] The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to different design decisions.[70] The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the de facto web standard for some time.[71]</p>

<h2>Markup</h2>
<p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>

<p>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p>

<p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p>The text between &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt; describes the web page, and the text between &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt; is the visible page content. The markup text &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt; defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window titles and the tag &lt;div&gt; defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between &lt;head&gt; and &lt;head&gt;, a &lt;meta&gt; element can be used to define webpage metadata.</p>

<p>The Document Type Declaration &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "quirks mode" for rendering.[72]</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>Main article: HTML element</p>
<p>HTML element content categories HTML documents imply a structure of nested HTML elements. These are indicated in the document by HTML tags, enclosed in angle brackets.[73][better source needed]</p>

<p>In the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a "start tag" &lt;p&gt; and "end tag" &lt;/p&gt;. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.</p>

<p>Tags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.</p>

<p>The start tag may also include the element's attributes within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the &lt;img&gt; used to embed images, the reference to the image resource in the format like this: &lt;img src="example.com/example.jpg"&gt;</p>

<p>Some elements, such as the line break &lt;br&gt; do not permit any embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.</p>

<p>Many tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element &lt;p&gt;, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML authors.</p>

<p>The general form of an HTML element is therefore: &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;''content''&lt;/tag&gt;. Some HTML elements are defined as empty elements and take the form &lt;tag attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2"&gt;. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the &lt;br&gt; tag or the inline &lt;img&gt; tag. The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags. The end tag's name is preceded by a slash character /. If a tag has no content, an end tag is not allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.</p>

<h2>Character and entity references</h2>
<p>See also: List of XML and HTML character entity references and Unicode and HTML</p>

<p>As of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 character entity references and a set of 1,114,050 numeric character references, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.</p>

<p>The ability to "escape" characters in this way allows for the characters &lt; and &amp; (when written as &amp;lt; and &amp;amp;, respectively) to be interpreted as character data, rather than markup. For example, a literal &lt; normally indicates the start of a tag, and &amp; normally indicates the start of a character entity reference or numeric character reference; writing it as &amp;amp; or &amp;#x26; or &amp;#38; allows &amp; to be included in the content of an element or in the value of an attribute. The double-quote character ("), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &amp;quot; or &amp;#x22; or &amp;#34; when it appears within the attribute value itself. Equivalently, the single-quote character ('), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as &amp;#x27; or &amp;#39; (or as &amp;apos; in HTML5 or XHTML documents[80][81]) when it appears within the attribute value itself. If document authors overlook the need to escape such characters, some browsers can be very forgiving and try to use context to guess their intent. The result is still invalid markup, which makes the document less accessible to other browsers and to other user agents that may try to parse the document for search and indexing purposes for example.</p>

<p>Escaping also allows for characters that are not easily typed, or that are not available in the document's character encoding, to be represented within the element and attribute content. For example, the acute‑accented e (é), a character typically found only on Western European and South American keyboards, can be written in any HTML document as the entity reference &amp;eacute; or as the numeric references &amp;#xE9; or &amp;#233;, using characters that are available on all keyboards and are supported in all character encodings. Unicode character encodings such as UTF-8 are compatible with all modern browsers and allow direct access to almost all the characters of the world's writing systems.[82]</p>
